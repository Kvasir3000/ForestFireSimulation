# Forest Fire Simulation 
The following project is a university assignment for the C++ programming module on my second year. The main aim was to create a console application, which would simulate the spread of forest fire, based on some conditions. In order to implement the program I used the discrete model known as celllular automata. The tree might catch a fire, if one of its neighbours is already burning (diagonal trees are not considered as neighbours). Wind direction, season, and the weather define the probability of catching a fire for a tree. The rainy weather can put out some of the burning trees, these kind of trees are considered as charred. For this project I implemented my own version of the linked list to store the forest.
